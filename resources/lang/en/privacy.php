As the ECJ has established, there is currently no level of data protection in the USA comparable to that in the EU, as US authorities and secret services could access this data.

                        This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that enable the analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on a server located in the United States. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, for compiling reports on website activity, and for providing other services relating to the website activity and internet activity to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser within Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. We would like to point out that your IP address will be sent to Google servers, which may be in the USA, i.e. a third country outside the EU. The USA currently does offer the same level of data protection that is provided within the EU. In particular, there are insufficient legal protection options. In addition, US laws allow US secret services and authorities such as CIA, NSA access to servers such as Google and "telephone and internet lines" from the USA, so that your IP address could potentially be accessed by the secret services. The previous agreements between the USA and the EU, Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield, which were supposed to ensure an adequate level of data protection between the USA and the EU, have been declared invalid by the European Court of Justice, so that they no longer apply. The EU and the US have to renegotiate the agreements. You can find the Google privacy policy under the following link: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.

                    Right to information
                    <p>
                        If you have asserted the right to have your data corrected or deleted or have restricted its further processing, we are obliged to notify all recipients to whom your personal data has been disclosed of the same unless this proves to be impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed about who these recipients are.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The right to data portability
                    <p>
                        You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we have on file about you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Moreover, you have the right to transmit this data to another data controller without any obstruction from the data controller to whom the personal data has been given, if
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR or on the basis of a contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR and</li>
                        <li><p>the processing takes place with the help of automated procedures.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        In exercising this right, you also have the right to have us transfer the personal data we have on file about you directly to another party if this is technically feasible. This action must not affect the freedoms and rights of other persons. The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority conferred on us.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Right of objection
                    <p>
                        You have the right, for reasons arising from your specific situation, to object to the processing of personal data concerning you at any time, which is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR; the same applies to profiling based on these provisions. We will no longer process the personal data relating to you unless we can prove a compelling legitimate reason for the same which outweighs your interests, rights, and freedoms, or unless the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend our legal claims. If the personal data that concerns you is being processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of the personal data that concerns you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing. If you object to processing that is for direct marketing purposes, the personal data that concerns you will no longer be processed for these purposes. In the context of the use of information company services, and Directive 2002/58/EC notwithstanding, you may exercise your right to object using an automated process.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The right to revoke the data protection declaration of consent
                    <p>
                        You have the right to revoke your consent to this Privacy policy or the processing of your data at any time. This revocation will not affect the lawfulness of any processing done beforehand.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Automated decision in individual cases, including profiling
                    <p>
                        You have the right not to be subject to a decision based exclusively on automated processing - including profiling - that has legal effect against you or significantly impairs you in a similar manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This shall not apply if the decision:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>is necessary for us to establish or fulfill a contract with you</li>
                        <li>is authorized by EU or national law to which we are subject, provided said law also sets forth suitable measures for safeguarding your rights, and freedoms, and legitimate interests; or</li>
                        <li><p>is based on your explicit consent.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR, unless Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a or g GDPR apply and appropriate measures have been taken to protect your rights and freedom as well as your legitimate interests. In the cases referred to in (1) and (3), we shall take reasonable measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, including, at a minimum, the right to obtain the intervention of a person on our part to state our position and to challenge the decision.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
                    <p>
                        Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State where you reside, work or where the infringement is suspected, if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.
