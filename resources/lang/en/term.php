                McSmart offers a Premium subscription that grants you access to additional features. You can purchase and/or subscribe to McSmart Premium or other paid products. By paying the subscription fee you get access to McSmart Premium during the time your subscription is valid, subject to these Terms and Conditions. All subscriptions for McSmart Premium are paid in advance. You may at any time terminate your membership, in which case your membership will still be valid for the subscription time you have already paid for.

McSmart reserves the right to change the subscription fees from time to time.

            <h5 class="mt-4">Minimum Age</h5>
            <p>
            We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at contact@mcsmart.app
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Using the App</h5>
            <p>
                Kemang Internet Pte Ltd is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to McSmart secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that your McSmart App won’t work properly or even not at all. Certain functions of the App will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider. Kemang Internet Pte Ltd cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. Along the same lines, you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the service, Kemang Internet Pte Ltd cannot accept responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we endeavour to ensure that the App is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Kemang Internet Pte Ltd accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App.
            </p>
            <p>
                At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on iOS and Android – the requirements for systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Kemang Internet Pte Ltd cannot guarantee that it will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your device. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.
            </p>
